# Kafka_Basics
A simple project for learning Kafka
In this project, I learnt about creating a docker image for zookeeper and kafka, adding kafka topics into kafka docker image, creating new kafka topics programatically etc.
Further, Learnt about how to send a Java object called RiderLocation from Producer to Consumer and serialization as well as deserialization techniques when it comes to handling object, sending to specific kafka topic etc.
In all, a basic project to understand and learn about kafka.
